## Background on Chronic Pain

::: {.incremental}

- Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists or recurs for 3 months or longer

- In 2020, approximately 619 million people globally were affected by low back pain

- Low back pain and neck pain have constantly been one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (Measuring with years lived with disability)

- The current gold standard for diagnosing chronic pain is patient self-report

- Traditional medical interventions include methods such as spinal injections, surgery, and pharmacological interventions

:::

## Virtual Reality for Rehabilitation

::: {.incremental}

- Non-pharmacological interventions include physical therapy, exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy

- Virtual Reality (VR) has been proposed as a (supplementary) tool for rehabilitation and pain management

- Several studies conducted under controlled trial settings have shown promising results, such as reduced pain intensity and reduced kinesiophobia (movevement-related fear of pain)

Study participants were given the opportunity to use a Virtual Reality (VR) headset on their own time for rehabilitation exercises.


::: {.incremental}

- Participants took part in a study with a tentative length of 12 weeks (not mandated) 

- The participants were instructed to use the VR environment freely to mimic real world usage

- Movement data were collected using Meta Oculus Quest 2 VR equipment (e.g. $x,y,z$ -coordinates of headset and hand controllers) at approximately 30 ms intervals

## Determining the Speed for Picking Objects

![](./images/speed_data-1.png)

## Hypotheses for Data Analysis

1. There is a difference in the movement speed of pain and reference subjects
1. The pain subjects improve their movement speed during the study

## Improvement Over Time

## Dealing with Real-World Data

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Monte Carlo Simulation

![](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1601823/frvir-06-1601823-HTML-r1/image_m/frvir-06-1601823-g004.jpg)

### Why and How? {.smaller}

- Real-world data is often messy and incomplete

- Monte Carlo simulation can be used to assess the robustness of the results

- Normalize picking speed to span values from 0 to 1

- Pick 4 random participants for each round

- Take bootstrap sample of 1001 observations from pooled data and fit regression line (Repeat 3000 rounds)

- Monte Carlo estimates of movement speed improvement for a hypothetical subject with average speeds ranging from 0.15 m/s to 1.1 m/s.
