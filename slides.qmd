## Background on Chronic Pain

::: {.incremental}

- Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists or recurs for 3 months or longer

- In 2020, approximately 619 million people globally were affected by low back pain

- Low back pain and neck pain have constantly been one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (Measuring with years lived with disability)

- The current gold standard for diagnosing chronic pain is patient self-report

- Traditional medical interventions include methods such as spinal injections, surgery, and pharmacological interventions

:::

## Virtual Reality for Rehabilitation

::: {.incremental}

- Non-pharmacological interventions include physical therapy, exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy

- Virtual Reality (VR) has been proposed as a (supplementary) tool for rehabilitation and pain management

- Several studies conducted under controlled trial settings have shown promising results, such as reduced pain intensity and reduced kinesiophobia (movevement-related fear of pain)

Study participants were given the opportunity to use a Virtual Reality (VR) headset on their own time for rehabilitation exercises.

## Hypotheses for Data Analysis

1. There is a difference in the movement speed of pain and reference subjects
1. The pain subjects improve their movement speed during the study
